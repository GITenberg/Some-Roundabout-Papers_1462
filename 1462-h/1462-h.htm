<h2>ON SOME CARP AT SANS SOUCI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have lately made the
acquaintance of an old lady of ninety, who has passed the last
twenty-five years of her old life in a great metropolitan
establishment, the workhouse, namely, of the parish of Saint
Lazarus.&nbsp; Stay&mdash;twenty-three or four years ago, she
came out once, and thought to earn a little money by hop-picking;
but being overworked, and having to lie out at night, she got a
palsy which has incapacitated her from all further labour, and
has caused her poor old limbs to shake ever since.</p>
<p>An illustration of that dismal proverb which tells us how
poverty makes us acquainted with strange bed-fellows, this poor
old shaking body has to lay herself down every night in her
workhouse bed by the side of some other old woman with whom she
may or may not agree.&nbsp; She herself can&rsquo;t be a very
pleasant bed-fellow, poor thing! with her shaking old limbs and
cold feet.&nbsp; She lies awake a deal of the night, to be sure,
not thinking of happy old times, for hers never were happy; but
sleepless with aches, and agues, and rheumatism of old age.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The gentleman gave me brandy-and-water,&rdquo; she said,
her old voice shaking with rapture at the thought.&nbsp; I never
had a great love for Queen Charlotte, but I like her better now
from what this old lady told me.&nbsp; The Queen, who loved snuff
herself, has left a legacy of snuff to certain poorhouses; and,
in her watchful nights, this old woman takes a pinch of Queen
Charlotte&rsquo;s snuff, &ldquo;and it do comfort me, sir, that
it do!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Pulveris exigui munus</i>.&nbsp; Here is a
forlorn aged creature, shaking with palsy, with no soul among the
great struggling multitude of mankind to care for her, not quite
trampled out of life, but past and forgotten in the rush, made a
little happy, and soothed in her hours of unrest by this penny
legacy.&nbsp; Let me think as I write.&nbsp; (The next
month&rsquo;s sermon, thank goodness! is safe to press.)&nbsp;
This discourse will appear at the season when I have read that
wassail-bowls make their appearance; at the season of pantomime,
turkey and sausages, plum-puddings, jollifications for
schoolboys; Christmas bills, and reminiscences more or less sad
and sweet for elders.&nbsp; If we oldsters are not merry, we
shall be having a semblance of merriment.&nbsp; We shall see the
young folks laughing round the holly-bush.&nbsp; We shall pass
the bottle round cosily as we sit by the fire.&nbsp; That old
thing will have a sort of festival too.&nbsp; Beef, beer, and
pudding will be served to her for that day also.&nbsp; Christmas
falls on a Thursday.&nbsp; Friday is the workhouse day for coming
out.&nbsp; Mary, remember that old Goody Twoshoes has her
invitation for Friday, 26th December!&nbsp; Ninety is she, poor
old soul?&nbsp; Ah! what a bonny face to catch under a
mistletoe!&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, ninety, sir,&rdquo; she says,
&ldquo;and my mother was a hundred, and my grandmother was a
hundred and two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herself ninety, her mother a hundred, her grandmother a
hundred and two?&nbsp; What a queer calculation!</p>
<p>Ninety!&nbsp; Very good, granny: you were born, then, in
1772.</p>
<p>Your mother, we will say, was twenty-seven when you were born,
and was born therefore in 1745.</p>
<p>Your grandmother was thirty-five when her daughter was born,
and was born therefore in 1710.</p>
<p>We will begin with the present granny first.&nbsp; My good old
creature, you can&rsquo;t of course remember, but that little
gentleman for whom you mother was laundress in the Temple was the
ingenious Mr Goldsmith, author of a &ldquo;History of
England,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield,&rdquo; and many
diverting pieces.&nbsp; You were brought almost an infant to his
chambers in Brick Court, and he gave you some sugar-candy, for
the doctor was always good to children.&nbsp; That gentleman who
well-nigh smothered you by sitting down on you as you lay in a
chair asleep was the learned Mr S. Johnson, whose history of
&ldquo;Rasselas&rdquo; you have never read, my pour soul; and
whose tragedy of &ldquo;Irene&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t believe any
man in these kingdoms ever perused.&nbsp; That tipsy Scotch
gentleman who used to come to the chambers sometimes, and at whom
everybody laughed, wrote a more amusing book than any of the
scholars, your Mr Burke and your Mr Johnson, and your Dr
Goldsmith.&nbsp; Your father often took him home in a chair to
his lodgings; and has done as much for Parson Sterne in Bond
Street, the famous wit.&nbsp; Of course, my good creature, you
remember the Gordon Riots, and crying No Popery before Mr
Langdale&rsquo;s house, the Popish distiller&rsquo;s, and that
bonny fire of my Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s books in Bloomsbury
Square?&nbsp; Bless us, what a heap of illuminations you have
seen! For the glorious victory over the Americans at
Breed&rsquo;s Hill; for the peace in 1814, and the beautiful
Chinese bridge in St James&rsquo;s Park; for the coronation of
his Majesty, whom you recollect as Prince of Wales, Goody,
don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Yes; and you went in a procession of
laundresses to pay your respects to his good lady, the injured
Queen of England, at Brandenburg House; and you remember your
mother told you how she was taken to see the Scotch lords
executed at the Tower.&nbsp; And as for your grandmother, she was
born five months after the battle of Malplaquet, she was; where
her poor father was killed, fighting like a bold Briton for the
Queen.&nbsp; With the help of a &ldquo;Wade&rsquo;s
Chronology,&rdquo; I can make out ever so queer a history for
you, my poor old body, and a pedigree as authentic as many in the
peerage-books.</p>
<p>Peerage-books and pedigrees?&nbsp; What does she know about
them? Battles and victories, treasons, kings, and beheadings,
literary gentlemen, and the like, what have they ever been to
her? Granny, did you ever hear of General Wolfe?&nbsp; Your
mother may have seen him embark, and your father may have carried
a musket under him.&nbsp; Your grandmother may have cried huzza
for Marlborough; but what is the Prince Duke to you, and did you
ever so much as hear tell of his name?&nbsp; How many hundred or
thousand of years had that toad lived who was in the coal at the
defunct exhibition?&mdash;and yet he was not a bit better
informed than toads seven or eight hundred years younger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me your nonsense about Exhibitions,
and Prince Dukes, and toads in coals, or coals in toads, or what
is it?&rdquo; says granny.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know there was a good
Queen Charlotte, for she left me snuff; and it comforts me of a
night when I lie awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To me there is something very touching in the notion of that
little pinch of comfort doled out to granny, and gratefully
inhaled by her in the darkness.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember
what traditions there used to be of chests of plate, bulses of
diamonds, laces of inestimable value, sent out of the country
privately by the old Queen, to enrich certain relatives in
M-ckl-nb-rg Str-l-tz?&nbsp; Not all the treasure went.&nbsp;
<i>Non omnis moritur</i>.&nbsp; A poor old palsied thing at
midnight is made happy sometimes as she lifts her shaking old
hand to her nose.&nbsp; Gliding noiselessly among the beds where
lie the poor creatures huddled in their cheerless dormitory, I
fancy an old ghost with a snuff-box that does not creak.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, Goody, take of my rappee.&nbsp; You will not
sneeze, and I shall not say &lsquo;God bless you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But you will think kindly of old Queen Charlotte, won&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; I had a many troubles, a many
troubles.&nbsp; I was a prisoner almost so much as you are.&nbsp;
I had to eat boiled mutton every day: <i>entre nous</i>, I
abominated it.&nbsp; But I never complained.&nbsp; I swallowed
it.&nbsp; I made the best of a hard life.&nbsp; We have all our
burdens to bear.&nbsp; But hark!&nbsp; I hear the cock-crow, and
snuff the morning air.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with this the royal ghost
vanishes up the chimney&mdash;if there be a chimney in that
dismal harem, where poor old Twoshoes and her companions pass
their nights&mdash;their dreary nights, their restless nights,
their cold long nights, shared in what glum companionship,
illumined by what a feeble taper!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I understand you, my good Twoshoes, to say that
your mother was seven-and-twenty years old when you were born,
and that she married your esteemed father when she herself was
twenty-five? 1745, then, was the date of your dear mother&rsquo;s
birth.&nbsp; I daresay her father was absent in the Low
Countries, with his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, under
whom he had the honour of carrying a halberd at the famous
engagement of Fontenoy&mdash;or if not there, he may have been at
Preston Pans, under General Sir John Cope, when the wild
Highlanders broke through all the laws of discipline and the
English lines; and, being on the spot, did he see the famous
ghost which didn&rsquo;t appear to Colonel Gardner of the
Dragoons?&nbsp; My good creature, is it possible you don&rsquo;t
remember that Doctor Swift, Sir Robert Walpole (my Lord Orford,
as you justly say), old Sarah Marlborough, and little Mr Pope, of
Twitnam, died in the year of your birth?&nbsp; What a wretched
memory you have!&nbsp; What? haven&rsquo;t they a library, and
the commonest books of reference at the old convent of Saint
Lazarus, where you dwell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Convent of Saint Lazarus, Prince William, Dr Swift,
Atossa, and Mr Pope, of Twitnam!&nbsp; What is the gentleman
talking about?&rdquo; says old goody, with a &ldquo;Ho!
ho!&rdquo; and a laugh like a old parrot&mdash;you know they live
to be as old as Methuselah, parrots do, and a parrot of a hundred
is comparatively young (ho! ho! ho!).&nbsp; Yes, and likewise
carps live to an immense old age.&nbsp; Some which Frederick the
Great fed at Sans Souci are there now, with great humps of blue
mould on their old backs; and they could tell all sorts of queer
stories, if they chose to speak&mdash;but they are very silent,
carps are&mdash;of their nature <i>peu communicatives</i>.&nbsp;
Oh! what has been thy long life, old goody, but a dole of bread
and water and a perch on a cage; a dreary swim round and round a
Lethe of a pond?&nbsp; What are Rossbach or Jena to those mouldy
ones, and do they know it is a grandchild of England who brings
bread to feed them?</p>
<p>No!&nbsp; Those Sans Souci carps may live to be a thousand
years old and have nothing to tell but that one day is like
another; and the history of friend Goody Twoshoes has not much
more variety than theirs.&nbsp; Hard labour, hard fare, hard bed,
numbing cold all night, and gnawing hunger most days.&nbsp; That
is her lot.&nbsp; Is it lawful in my prayers to say, &ldquo;Thank
heaven, I am not as one of these&rdquo;?&nbsp; If I were eighty,
would I like to feel the hunger always gnawing, gnawing? to have
to get up and make a bow when Mr Bumble the beadle entered the
common room? to have to listen to Miss Prim, who came to give me
her ideas of the next world?&nbsp; If I were eighty, I own I
should not like to have to sleep with another gentleman of my own
age, gouty, a bad sleeper, kicking in his old dreams, and
snoring; to march down my vale of years at word of command,
accommodating my tottering old steps to those of the other
prisoners in my dingy, hopeless old gang; to hold out a trembling
hand for a sickly pittance of gruel, and say, &ldquo;Thank you,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; to Miss Prim, when she has done reading her
sermon.&nbsp; John! when Goody Twoshoes comes next Friday, I
desire she may not be disturbed by theological
controversies.&nbsp; You have a fair voice, and I heard you and
the maids singing a hymn very sweetly the other night, and was
thankful that our humble household should be in such
harmony.&nbsp; Poor old Twoshoes is so old and toothless and
quaky, that she can&rsquo;t sing a bit; but don&rsquo;t be giving
yourself airs over her, because she can&rsquo;t sing and you
can.&nbsp; Make her comfortable at our kitchen hearth.&nbsp; Set
that old kettle to sing by our hob.&nbsp; Warm her old stomach
with nut-brown ale and a toast laid in the fire.&nbsp; Be kind to
the poor old school-girl of ninety, who has had leave to come out
for a day of Christmas holiday.&nbsp; Shall there be many more
Christmases for thee?&nbsp; Think of the ninety she has seen
already; the four-score and ten cold, cheerless, nipping New
Years!</p>
<p>If you were in her place, would you like to have a remembrance
of better early days, when you were young and happy, and loving,
perhaps; or would you prefer to have no past on which your mind
could rest?&nbsp; About the year 1788, Goody, were your cheeks
rosy, and your eyes bright, and did some young fellow in powder
and a pigtail look in them?&nbsp; We may grow old, but to us some
stories never are old.&nbsp; On a sudden they rise up, not dead,
but living&mdash;not forgotten, but freshly remembered.&nbsp; The
eyes gleam on us as they used to do.&nbsp; The dear voice thrills
in our hearts.&nbsp; The rapture of the meeting, the terrible,
terrible parting, again and again the tragedy is acted
over.&nbsp; Yesterday, in the street, I saw a pair of eyes so
like two which used to brighten at my coming once, that the whole
past came back as I walked lonely, in the rush of the Strand, and
I was young again in the midst of joys and sorrows, alike sweet
and sad, alike sacred and fondly remembered.</p>
<p>If I tell a tale out of school, will any harm come to my old
school-girl?&nbsp; Once, a lady gave her a half-sovereign, which
was a source of great pain and anxiety to Goody Twoshoes.&nbsp;
She sewed it away in her old stays somewhere, thinking here at
least was a safe investment&mdash;(vestis&mdash;a vest&mdash;an
investment,&mdash;pardon me, thou poor old thing, but I cannot
help the pleasantry).&nbsp; And what do you think?&nbsp; Another
pensionnaire of the establishment cut the coin out of
Goody&rsquo;s stays&mdash;<i>an old woman who went upon two
crutches</i>!&nbsp; Faugh, the old witch!&nbsp; What?&nbsp;
Violence amongst these toothless, tottering, trembling, feeble
ones?&nbsp; Robbery amongst the penniless?&nbsp; Dogs coming and
snatching Lazarus&rsquo;s crumbs out of his lap?&nbsp; Ah, how
indignant Goody was as she told the story!&nbsp; To that pond at
Potsdam where the carps live for hundreds of hundreds of years,
with hunches of blue mould on their back, I daresay the little
Prince and Princess of Preussen-Britannien come sometimes with
crumbs and cakes to feed the mouldy ones.&nbsp; Those eyes may
have goggled from beneath the weeds at Napoleon&rsquo;s
jack-boots: they have seen Frederick&rsquo;s lean shanks
reflected in their pool; and perhaps Monsieur de Voltaire has fed
them, and now for a crumb of biscuit they will fight, push,
hustle, rob, squabble, gobble, relapsing into their tranquillity
when the ignoble struggle is over.&nbsp; Sans souci,
indeed!&nbsp; It is mighty well writing &ldquo;Sans souci&rdquo;
over the gate; but where is the gate through which Care has not
slipped?&nbsp; She perches on the shoulders of the sentry in the
sentry-box: she whispers the porter sleeping in his arm-chair:
she glides up the staircase, and lies down between the king and
queen in their bed-royal: this very night I daresay she will
perch upon poor old Goody Twoshoes&rsquo; meagre bolster, and
whisper, &ldquo;Will the gentleman and those ladies ask me
again!&nbsp; No, no; they will forget poor old Twoshoes.&rdquo;
Goody!&nbsp; For shame of yourself!&nbsp; Do not be
cynical.&nbsp; Do not mistrust your fellow-creatures.&nbsp;
What?&nbsp; Has the Christmas morning dawned upon thee ninety
times?&nbsp; For four-score and ten years has it been thy lot to
totter on this earth, hungry and obscure? Peace and goodwill to
thee, let us say at this Christmas season.&nbsp; Come, drink,
eat, rest awhile at our hearth, thou poor old pilgrim!&nbsp; And
of the bread which God&rsquo;s bounty gives us, I pray, brother
reader, we may not forget to set aside a part for those noble and
silent poor, from whose innocent hands war has torn the means of
labour.&nbsp; Enough!&nbsp; As I hope for beef at Christmas, I
vow a note shall be sent to Saint Lazarus Union House, in which
Mr Roundabout requests the honour of Mrs Twoshoes&rsquo; company
on Friday, 26th December.</p>
<h2>DE JUVENTUTE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> who lived before railways, and
survive out of the ancient world, are like Father Noah and his
family out of the Ark.&nbsp; The children will gather round and
say to us patriarchs, &ldquo;Tell us, grandpapa, about the old
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we shall mumble our old stories; and we
shall drop off one by one; and there will be fewer and fewer of
us, and these very old and feeble.&nbsp; There will be but ten
pr&aelig;-railroadites left: then three&mdash;then two&mdash;then
one&mdash;then 0!&nbsp; If the hippopotamus had the least
sensibility (of which I cannot trace any signs either in his hide
or his face), I think he would go down to the bottom of his tank,
and never come up again.&nbsp; Does he not see that he belongs to
bygone ages, and that his great hulking barrel of a body is out
of place in these times?&nbsp; What has he in common with the
brisk young life surrounding him?&nbsp; In the watches of the
night, when the keepers are asleep, when the birds are on one
leg, when even the little armadillo is quiet, and the monkeys
have ceased their chatter, he&mdash;I mean the
hippopotamus&mdash;and the elephant, and the long-necked giraffe,
perhaps may lay their heads together and have a colloquy about
the great silent antediluvian world which they remember, where
mighty monsters floundered through the ooze, crocodiles basked on
the banks, and dragons darted out of the caves and waters before
men were made to slay them.&nbsp; We who lived before railways
are antediluvians&mdash;we must pass away.&nbsp; We are growing
scarcer every day; and old&mdash;old&mdash;very old relicts of
the times when George was still fighting the Dragon.</p>
<p>Not long since, a company of horseriders paid a visit to our
watering-place.&nbsp; We went to see them, and I bethought me
that young Walter Juvenis, who was in the place, might like also
to witness the performance.&nbsp; A pantomime is not always
amusing to persons who have attained a certain age; but a boy at
a pantomime is always amused and amusing, and to see his pleasure
is good for most hypochondriacs.</p>
<p>We sent to Walter&rsquo;s mother, requesting that he might
join us, and the kind lady replied that the boy had already been
at the morning performance of the equestrians, but was most eager
to go in the evening likewise.&nbsp; And go he did; and laughed
at all Mr Merryman&rsquo;s remarks, though he remembered them
with remarkable accuracy, and insisted upon waiting to the very
end of the fun, and was only induced to retire just before its
conclusion by representations that the ladies of the party would
be incommoded if they were to wait and undergo the rush and
trample of the crowd round about.&nbsp; When this fact was
pointed out to him, he yielded at once, though with a heavy
heart, his eyes looking longingly towards the ring as we
retreated out of the booth.&nbsp; We were scarcely clear of the
place, when we heard &ldquo;God save the Queen,&rdquo; played by
the equestrian band, the signal that all was over.&nbsp; Our
companion entertained us with scraps of the dialogue on our way
home&mdash;precious crumbs of wit which he had brought away from
that feast.&nbsp; He laughed over them again as he walked under
the stars.&nbsp; He has them now, and takes them out of the
pocket of his memory, and crunches a bit, and relishes it with a
sentimental tenderness, too, for he is, no doubt, back at school
by this time; the holidays are over; and Doctor Birch&rsquo;s
young friends have reassembled.</p>
<p>Queer jokes, which caused a thousand simple mouths to
grin!&nbsp; As the jaded Merryman uttered them to the old
gentleman with the whip, some of the old folks in the audience, I
daresay, indulged in reflections of their own.&nbsp; There was
one joke&mdash;I utterly forget it&mdash;but it began with
Merryman saying what he had for dinner.&nbsp; He had mutton for
dinner, at one o&rsquo;clock, after which &ldquo;he had to
<i>come to business</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then came the
point.&nbsp; Walter Juvenis, Esq., Rev. Doctor Birch&rsquo;s,
Market Rodborough, if you read this, will you please send me a
line, and let me know what was the joke Mr Merryman made about
having his dinner?&nbsp; <i>You</i> remember well enough.&nbsp;
But do I want to know?&nbsp; Suppose a boy takes a favourite,
long-cherished lump of cake out of his pocket, and offers you a
bit?&nbsp; <i>Merci</i>!&nbsp; The fact is, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
care much about knowing that joke of Mr Merryman&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But whilst he was talking about his dinner, and his mutton,
and his landlord, and his business, I felt a great interest about
Mr M. in private life&mdash;about his wife, lodgings, earnings,
and general history, and I daresay was forming a picture of those
in my mind:&mdash;wife cooking the mutton; children waiting for
it; Merryman in his plain clothes, and so forth; during which
contemplation the joke was uttered and laughed at, and Mr M.,
resuming his professional duties, was tumbling over head and
heels.&nbsp; Do not suppose I am going, <i>sicut est mos</i>, to
indulge in moralities about buffoons, paint, motley, and
mountebanking.&nbsp; Nay, Prime Ministers rehearse their jokes;
Opposition leaders prepare and polish them: Tabernacle preachers
must arrange them in their minds before they utter them.&nbsp;
All I mean is, that I would like to know any one of these
performers thoroughly, and out of his uniform: that preacher, and
why in his travels this and that point struck him; wherein lies
his power of pathos, humour, eloquence;&mdash;that Minister of
State, and what moves him, and how his private heart is
working;&mdash;I would only say that, at a certain time of life
certain things cease to interest: but about <i>some</i> things
when we cease to care, what will be the use of life, sight,
hearing?&nbsp; Poems are written, and we cease to admire.&nbsp;
Lady Jones invites us, and we yawn; she ceases to invite us, and
we are resigned.&nbsp; The last time I saw a ballet at the
opera&mdash;oh! it is many years ago&mdash;I fell asleep in the
stalls, wagging my head in insane dreams, and I hope affording
amusement to the company, while the feet of five hundred nymphs
were cutting flicflacs on the stage at a few paces distant.&nbsp;
Ah, I remember a different state of things!&nbsp; <i>Credite
posteri</i>.&nbsp; To see these nymphs&mdash;gracious powers, how
beautiful they were!&nbsp; That leering, painted, shrivelled,
thin-armed, thick-ankled old thing, cutting dreary capers, coming
thumping down on her board out of time&mdash;<i>that</i> an
opera-dancer?&nbsp; Pooh!&nbsp; My dear Walter, the great
difference between my time and yours, who will enter life some
two or three years hence, is that, now, the dancing women and
singing women are ludicrously old, out of time, and out of tune;
the paint is so visible, and the dinge and wrinkles of their
wretched old cotton stockings, that I am surprised how anybody
can like to look at them.&nbsp; And as for laughing at me for
falling asleep, I can&rsquo;t understand a man of sense doing
otherwise.&nbsp; In my time, <i>&agrave; la bonne
heure</i>.&nbsp; In the reign of George IV., I give you my
honour, all the dancers at the opera were as beautiful as
Houris.&nbsp; Even in William IV.&rsquo;s time, when I think of
Duvernay prancing in as the Bayad&egrave;re,&mdash;I say it was a
vision of loveliness such as mortal eyes can&rsquo;t see
nowadays.&nbsp; How well I remember the tune to which she used to
appear!&nbsp; Kaled used to say to the Sultan, &ldquo;My lord, a
troop of those dancing and singing gurls called Bayaderes
approaches,&rdquo; and, to the clash of cymbals, and the thumping
of my heart, in she used to dance!&nbsp; There has never been
anything like it&mdash;never.&nbsp; There never will be&mdash;I
laugh to scorn old people who tell me about your Noblet, your
Montessu, your Vistris, your Parisot&mdash;pshaw, the senile
twaddlers!&nbsp; And the impudence of the young men, with their
music and their dancers of to-day!&nbsp; I tell you the women are
dreary old creatures.&nbsp; I tell you one air in an opera is
just like another, and they send all rational creatures to
sleep.&nbsp; Ah, Ronzi de Begnis, thou lovely one!&nbsp; Ah,
Caradori, thou smiling angel!&nbsp; Ah, Malibran!&nbsp; Nay, I
will come to modern times, and acknowledge that Lablache was a
very good singer thirty years ago (though Porto was the boy for
me): and they we had Ambrogetti, and Curioni, and Donzelli, a
rising young singer.</p>
<p>But what is most certain and lamentable is the decay of stage
beauty since the days of George IV.&nbsp; Think of Sontag!&nbsp;
I remember her in <i>Otello</i> and the <i>Donna del Lago</i> in
&rsquo;28.&nbsp; I remember being behind the scenes at the opera
(where numbers of us young fellows of fashion used to go), and
seeing Sontag let her hair fall down over her shoulders previous
to her murder by Donzelli.&nbsp; Young fellows have never seen
beauty like <i>that</i>, heard such a voice, seen such hair, such
eyes.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i>!&nbsp; A man who has been
about town since the reign of George IV., ought he not to know
better than you young lads who have seen nothing?&nbsp; The
deterioration of women is lamentable; and the conceit of the
young fellows more lamentable still, that they won&rsquo;t see
this fact, but persist in thinking their time as good as
ours.</p>
<p>Bless me! when I was a lad, the stage was covered with angels,
who sang, acted, and danced.&nbsp; When I remember the Adelphi,
and the actresses there: when I think of Miss Chester, and Miss
Love, and Mrs Serle at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells, and her forty
glorious pupils&mdash;of the Opera and Noblet, and the exquisite
young Taglioni, and Pauline Leroux, and a host more!&nbsp; One
much-admired being of those days I confess I never cared for, and
that was the chief <i>male</i> dancer&mdash;a very important
personage then, with a bare neck, bare arms, a tunic, and a hat
and feathers, who used to divide the applause with the ladies,
and who has now sunk down a trap-door for ever.&nbsp; And this
frank admission ought to show that I am not your mere twaddling
<i>laudator temporis acti</i>&mdash;your old fogey who can see no
good except in his own time.</p>
<p>They say that claret is better nowadays, and cookery much
improved since the days of <i>my</i> monarch&mdash;of George
IV.&nbsp; <i>Pastry Cookery</i> is certainly not so good.&nbsp; I
have often eaten half-a-crown&rsquo;s worth (including, I trust,
ginger-beer) at our school pastrycook&rsquo;s, and that is a
proof that the pastry must have been very good, for could I do as
much now?&nbsp; I passed by the pastrycook&rsquo;s shop lately,
having occasion to visit my old school.&nbsp; It looked a very
dingy old baker&rsquo;s; misfortunes may have come over
him&mdash;those penny tarts certainly did not look so nice as I
remember them: but he may have grown careless as he has grown old
(I should judge him to be now about ninety-six years of age), and
his hand may have lost its cunning.</p>
<p>Not that we were not great epicures.&nbsp; I remember how we
constantly grumbled at the quantity of the food in our
master&rsquo;s house&mdash;which on my conscience I believe was
excellent and plentiful&mdash;and how we tried once or twice to
eat him out of house and home.&nbsp; At the pastrycook&rsquo;s we
may have over-eaten ourselves (I have admitted
half-a-crown&rsquo;s worth for my own part, but I don&rsquo;t
like to mention the <i>real</i> figure for fear of perverting the
present generation of boys by my monstrous confession)&mdash;we
may have eaten too much, I say.&nbsp; We did; but what
then?&nbsp; The school apothecary was sent for: a couple of small
globules at night, a trifling preparation of senna in the
morning, and we had not to go to school, so that the draught was
an actual pleasure.</p>
<p>For our amusements, besides the games in vogue, which were
pretty much in old times as they are now (except cricket <i>par
exemple</i>&mdash;and I wish the present youth joy of their
bowling, and suppose Armstrong and Whitworth will bowl at them
with light field-pieces next), there were novels&mdash;ah! I
trouble you to find such novels in the present day!&nbsp; O
Scottish Chiefs, didn&rsquo;t we weep over you! O Mysteries of
Udolpho, didn&rsquo;t I and Briggs Minor draw pictures out of
you, as I have said?&nbsp; Efforts, feeble indeed, but still
giving pleasure to us and our friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, old
boy, draw us Vivaldi tortured in the Inquisition,&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;Draw us Don Quixote and the windmills, you know,&rdquo;
amateurs would say, to boys who had a love of drawing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Peregrine Pickle&rdquo; we liked, our fathers admiring it,
and telling us (the sly old boys) it was capital fun; but I think
I was rather bewildered by it, though &ldquo;Roderick
Random&rdquo; was and remains delightful.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
remember having Sterne in the school library, no doubt because
the works of that divine were not considered decent for young
people.&nbsp; Ah! not against thy genius, O father of Uncle Toby
and Trim, would I say a word in disrespect.&nbsp; But I am
thankful to live in times when men no longer have the temptation
to write so as to call blushes on women&rsquo;s cheeks, and would
shame to whisper wicked allusions to honest boys.&nbsp; Then,
above all, we had <span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>, the
kindly, the generous, the pure&mdash;the companion of what
countless delightful hours; the purveyor of how much happiness;
the friend whom we recall as the constant benefactor of our
youth! How well I remember the type and the brownish paper of the
old duodecimo &ldquo;Tales of My Landlord!&rdquo;&nbsp; I have
never dared to read the &ldquo;Pirate,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Bride of Lammermoor,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kenilworth,&rdquo;
from that day to this, because the finale is unhappy, and people
die, and are murdered at the end.&nbsp; But
&ldquo;Ivanhoe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quentin Durward&rdquo;!&nbsp;
Oh! for a half-holiday, and a quiet corner, and one of those
books again!&nbsp; Those books, and perhaps those eyes with which
we read them; and, it may be, the brains behind the eyes! It may
be the tart was good; but how fresh the appetite was!&nbsp; If
the gods would give me the desire of my heart, I should be able
to write a story which boys would relish for the next few dozen
of centuries.&nbsp; The boy-critic loves the story: grown up, he
loves the author who wrote the story.&nbsp; Hence the kindly tie
is established between writer and reader, and lasts pretty nearly
for life.&nbsp; I meet people now who don&rsquo;t care of Walter
Scott, or the &ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo;; I am sorry for them,
unless they in their time have found <i>their</i>
romancer&mdash;their charming Scheherazade.&nbsp; By the way,
Walter, when you are writing, tell me who is the favourite
novelist in the fourth form now?&nbsp; Have you got anything so
good and kindly as dear Miss Edgeworth&rsquo;s
<i>Frank</i>?&nbsp; It used to belong to a fellow&rsquo;s sisters
generally; but though he pretended to despise it, and said,
&ldquo;Oh, stuff for girls!&rdquo; he read it; and I think there
were one or two passages which would try my eyes now, were I to
meet with the little book.</p>
<p>As for Thomas and Jeremiah (it is only my witty way of calling
Tom and Jerry), I went to the British Museum the other day on
purpose to get it; but somehow, if you will press the question so
closely, on reperusal, Tom and Jerry is not so brilliant as I had
supposed it to be.&nbsp; The pictures are just as fine as ever;
and I shook hands with broad-backed Jerry Hawthorn and Corinthian
Tom with delight, after many year&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; But the
style of the writing, I own, was not pleasing to me; I even
thought it a little vulgar&mdash;well! well! other writers have
been considered vulgar&mdash;and as a description of the sports
and amusements of London in the ancient times, more curious than
amusing.</p>
<p>But the pictures!&mdash;oh! the pictures are noble
still!&nbsp; First, there is Jerry arriving from the country, in
a green coat and leather gaiters, and being measured for a
fashionable suit at Corinthian House, by Corinthian Tom&rsquo;s
tailor.&nbsp; Then away for the career of pleasure and
fashion.&nbsp; The park! delicious excitement! The theatre! the
saloon!! the green-room!!!&nbsp; Rapturous bliss&mdash;the opera
itself! and then perhaps to Temple Bar, to <i>knock down a
Charley</i> there!&nbsp; There are Jerry and Tom, with their
tights and little cocked hats, coming from the opera&mdash;very
much as gentlemen in waiting on royalty are habited now.&nbsp;
There they are at Almack&rsquo;s itself, amidst a crowd of
high-bred personages, with the Duke of Clarence himself looking
at them dancing.&nbsp; Now, strange change, they are in Tom
Cribb&rsquo;s parlour, where they don&rsquo;t seem to be a whit
less at home than in fashion&rsquo;s gilded halls; and now they
are at Newgate, seeing the irons knocked off the
malefactors&rsquo; legs previous to execution.&nbsp; What
hardened ferocity in the countenance of the desperado in yellow
breeches!&nbsp; What compunction in the face of the gentleman in
black (who, I suppose, has been forging), and who clasps his
hands, and listens to the chaplain!&nbsp; Now we haste away to
merrier scenes: to Tattersall&rsquo;s (ah gracious powers! what a
funny fellow that actor was who performed Dicky Green in that
scene in the play!); and now we are at a private party, at which
Corinthian Tom is waltzing (and very gracefully too, as you must
confess) with Corinthian Kate, whilst Bob Logic, the Oxonian, is
playing on the piano!</p>
<p>&ldquo;After,&rdquo; the text says, &ldquo;<i>the Oxonian</i>
had played several pieces of lively music, he requested as a
favour that Kate and his friend Tom would perform a waltz.&nbsp;
Kate without any hesitation immediately stood up.&nbsp; Tom
offered his hand to his fascinating partner, and the dance took
place.&nbsp; The plate conveys a correct representation of the
&lsquo;gay scene&rsquo; at that precise moment.&nbsp; The anxiety
of the <i>Oxonian</i> to witness the attitudes of the elegant
pair had nearly put a stop to their movements.&nbsp; On turning
round from the pianoforte and presenting his comical <i>mug</i>,
Kate could scarcely suppress a laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And no wonder; just look at it now (as I have copied it to the
best of my humble ability), and compare Master Logic&rsquo;s
countenance and attitude with the splendid elegance of Tom!&nbsp;
Now every London man is weary and <i>blas&eacute;</i>.&nbsp;
There is an enjoyment of life in these young bucks of 1823 which
contrasts strangely with our feelings of 1860.&nbsp; Here, for
instance, is a specimen of their talk and walk, &ldquo;If,&rsquo;
says <span class="smcap">Logic</span>&mdash;&lsquo;if
<i>enjoyment</i> is your <i>motto</i>, you may make the most of
an evening at Vauxhall, more than at any other place in the
metropolis.&nbsp; It is all free and easy.&nbsp; Stay as long as
you like, and depart when you think
proper.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Your description is so
flattering,&rsquo; replied <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>,
&lsquo;that I do not care how soon the time arrives for us to
start.&rsquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Logic</span> proposed a
&lsquo;<i>bit of a stroll</i>&rsquo; in order to get rid of an
hour or two, which was immediately accepted by Tom and
Jerry.&nbsp; A <i>turn</i> or two in Bond Street, a <i>stroll</i>
through Piccadilly, a <i>look in</i> at <span
class="smcap">Tattersall</span>&rsquo;s, a <i>ramble</i> through
Pall Mall, and a <i>strut</i> on the Corinthian path, fully
occupied the time of our heroes until the hour for dinner
arrived, when a few glasses of <span
class="smcap">Tom</span>&rsquo;s rich wines soon put them on the
<i>qui vive</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Vauxhall</span> was
then the object in view, and the <span class="smcap">Trio</span>
started, bent upon enjoying the pleasures which this place so
amply affords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How nobly those inverted commas, those italics, those
capitals, bring out the writer&rsquo;s wit and relieve the
eye!&nbsp; They are as good as jokes, though you mayn&rsquo;t
quite preceive the point.&nbsp; Mark the varieties of lounge in
which the young men indulge&mdash;now a <i>stroll</i>, then a
<i>look in</i>, then a <i>ramble</i>, and presently a
<i>strut</i>.&nbsp; When George, Prince of Wales, was twenty, I
have read in an old Magazine, &ldquo;the Prince&rsquo;s
lounge&rdquo; was a peculiar manner of walking which the young
bucks imitated.&nbsp; At Windsor George III. had a <i>cat&rsquo;s
path</i>&mdash;a sly early walk which the good old king took in
the grey morning before his household was astir.&nbsp; What was
the Corinthian path here recorded?&nbsp; Does any antiquary
know?&nbsp; And what were the rich wines which our friends took,
and which enable them to enjoy Vauxhall?&nbsp; Vauxhall is gone,
but the wines which could occasion such a delightful perversion
of the intellect as to enable it to enjoy ample pleasures there,
what were they?</p>
<p>So the game of life proceeds, until Jerry Hawthorn, the
rustic, is fairly knocked up by all this excitement and is forced
to go home, and the last picture represents him getting into the
coach at the &ldquo;White Horse Cellar,&rdquo; he being one of
six inside; whilst his friends shake him by the hand; whilst the
sailor mounts on the roof; whilst the Jews hang round with
oranges, knives, and sealing-wax: whilst the guard is closing the
door.&nbsp; Where are they now, those sealing-wax vendors? where
are the guards? where are the jolly teams? where are the coaches?
and where the youth that climbed inside and out of them; that
heard the merry horn which sounds no more; that saw the sun rise
over Stonehenge; that rubbed away the bitter tears at night after
parting as the coach sped on the journey to school and London;
that looked out with beating heart as the milestones flew by, for
the welcome corner where began home and holidays.</p>
<p>It is night now: and here is home.&nbsp; Gathered under the
quiet roof elders and children lie alike at rest.&nbsp; In the
midst of a great peace and calm, the stars look out from the
heavens.&nbsp; The silence is peopled with the past; sorrowful
remorses for sins and shortcomings&mdash;memories of passionate
joys and griefs rise out of their graves, both now alike calm and
sad.&nbsp; Eyes, as I shut mine, look at me, that have long
ceased to shine.&nbsp; The town and the fair landscape sleep
under the starlight, wreathed in the autumn mists.&nbsp;
Twinkling among the houses a light keeps watch here and there, in
what may be a sick chamber or two.&nbsp; The clock tolls sweetly
in the silent air.&nbsp; Here is night and rest.&nbsp; An awful
sense of thanks makes the heart swell, and the head bow, as I
pass to my room through the sleeping house, and feel as though a
hushed blessing were upon it.</p>
<h2>ROUND ABOUT THE CHRISTMAS TREE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> kindly Christmas tree, from
which I trust every gentle reader has pulled out a bonbon or two,
is yet all aflame whilst I am writing, and sparkles with the
sweet fruits of its season.&nbsp; You young ladies, may you have
plucked pretty giftlings from it; and out of the cracker
sugar-plum which you have split with the captain or the sweet
young curate may you have read one of those delicious conundrums
which the confectioners introduce into the sweetmeats, and which
apply to the cunning passion of love.&nbsp; Those riddles are to
be read at <i>your</i> age, when I daresay they are
amusing.&nbsp; As for Dolly, Merry, and Bell, who are standing at
the tree, they don&rsquo;t care about the love-riddle part, but
understand the sweet-almoned portion very well.&nbsp; They are
four, five, six years old.&nbsp; Patience, little people!&nbsp; A
dozen merry Christmases more, and you will be reading those
wonderful love-conundrums, too.&nbsp; As for us elderly folks, we
watch the babies at their sport, and the young people pulling at
the branches: and instead of finding bonbons or sweeties in the
packets which we pluck off the boughs, we find enclosed Mr
Carnifex&rsquo;s review of the quarter&rsquo;s meat; Mr
Sartor&rsquo;s compliments, and little statement for self and the
young gentlemen; and Madame de Sainte-Crinoline&rsquo;s respects
to the young ladies, who encloses her account, and will sent on
Saturday, please; or we stretch our hand out to the educational
branch of the Christmas tree, and there find a lively and amusing
article from the Rev. Henry Holyshade, containing our dear
Tommy&rsquo;s exceedingly moderate account for the last
term&rsquo;s school expenses.</p>
<p>The tree yet sparkles, I say.&nbsp; I am writing on the day
before Twelfth Day, if you must know; but already ever so many of
the fruits have been pulled, and the Christmas lights have gone
out.&nbsp; Bobby Miseltow, who has been staying with us for a
week (and who has been sleeping mysteriously in the bath-room),
comes to say he is going away to spend the rest of the holidays
with his grandmother&mdash;and I brush away the manly tear of
regret as I part with the dear child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Bob,
good-bye, since you <i>will</i> go.&nbsp; Compliments to
grandmamma.&nbsp; Thank her for the turkey.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>A slight pecuniary transaction takes
place at this juncture</i>, <i>and Bob nods and winks</i>, <i>and
puts his hand in his waistcoat pocket</i>.)&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
had a pleasant week?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
I!&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>And exit</i>, <i>anxious to know the amount
of the coin which has just changed hands</i>.)</p>
<p>He is gone, and as the dear boy vanishes through the door
(behind which I see him perfectly), I too cast up a little
account of our past Christmas week.&nbsp; When Bob&rsquo;s
holidays are over, and the printer has sent me back this
manuscript, I know Christmas will be an old story.&nbsp; All the
fruit will be off the Christmas tree then; the crackers will have
cracked off; the almonds will have been crunched; and the
sweet-bitter riddles will have been read; the lights will have
perished off the dark green boughs; the toys growing on them will
have been distributed, fought for, cherished, neglected,
broken.&nbsp; Ferdinand and Fidelia will each keep out of it (be
still, my gushing heart!) the remembrance of a riddle read
together, of a double almond munched together, and of the moiety
of an exploded cracker. . . .&nbsp; The maids, I say, will have
taken down all that holly stuff and nonsense about the clocks,
lamps, and looking-glasses, the dear boys will be back at school,
fondly thinking of the pantomime fairies whom they have seen;
whose gaudy gossamer wings are battered by this time; and whose
pink cotton (or silk is it?) lower extremities are all dingy and
dusty.&nbsp; Yet but a few days, Bob, and flakes of paint will
have cracked off the fairy flower-bowers, and the revolving
temples of adamantine lustre will be as shabby as the city of
Pekin.&nbsp; When you read this, will Clown still be going on
lolling his tongue out of his mouth, and saying, &ldquo;How are
you to-morrow?&rdquo;&nbsp; To-morrow, indeed!&nbsp; He must be
almost ashamed of himself (if that cheek is still capable of the
blush of shame) for asking the absurd question.&nbsp; To-morrow,
indeed!&nbsp; To-morrow the diffugient snows will give place to
spring; the snowdrops will lift their heads; Ladyday may be
expected, and the pecuniary duties peculiar to that feast; in
place of bonbons, trees will have an eruption of light green
knobs; the whitebait season will bloom . . . as if one need go on
describing these vernal phenomena, when Christmas is still here,
though ending, and the subject of my discourse!</p>
<p>We have all admired the illustrated papers, and noted how
boisterously jolly they become at Christmas time.&nbsp; What
wassail-bowls, robin-redbreasts, waits, snow landscapes, bursts
of Christmas song!&nbsp; And then to think that these festivities
are prepared months before&mdash;that these Christmas pieces are
prophetic!&nbsp; How kind of artists and poets to devise the
festivities beforehand, and serve them pat at the proper time! We
ought to be grateful to them, as to the cook who gets up at
midnight and sets the pudding a-boiling, which is to feast us at
six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I often think with gratitude of the
famous Mr Nelson Lee&mdash;the author of I don&rsquo;t know how
many hundred glorious pantomimes&mdash;walking by the summer wave
at Margate, or Brighton perhaps, revolving in his mind the idea
of some new gorgeous spectacle of fa&euml;ry, which the winter
shall see complete.&nbsp; He is like cook at midnight (<i>si
parva licet</i>).&nbsp; He watches and thinks.&nbsp; He pounds
the sparkling sugar of benevolence, the plums of fancy, the
sweetmeats of fun, the figs of&mdash;well, the figs of fairy
fiction, let us say, and pops the whole in the seething cauldron
of imagination, and at due season serves up the <span
class="smcap">Pantomime</span>.</p>
<p>Very few men in the course of nature can expect to see
<i>all</i> the pantomimes in one season, but I hope to the end of
my life I shall never forego reading about them in that delicious
sheet of <i>The Times</i> which appears on the morning after
Boxing-day.&nbsp; Perhaps reading is even better than
seeing.&nbsp; The best way, I think, is to say you are ill, lie
in bed, and have the paper for two hours, reading all the way
down from Drury Lane to the Britannia at Hoxton.&nbsp; Bob and I
went to two pantomimes.&nbsp; One was at the Theatre of Fancy,
and the other at the Fairy Opera, and I don&rsquo;t know which we
liked the best.</p>
<p>At the Fancy, we saw &ldquo;Harlequin Hamlet, or Daddy&rsquo;s
Ghost and Nunky&rsquo;s Pison,&rdquo; which is all very
well&mdash;but, gentlemen, if you don&rsquo;t respect Shakspeare,
to whom will you be civil?&nbsp; The palace and ramparts of
Elsinore by moon and snowlight is one of Loutherbourg&rsquo;s
finest efforts.&nbsp; The banqueting hall of the palace is
illuminated: the peaks and gables glitter with the snow: the
sentinels march blowing their fingers with the cold&mdash;the
freezing of the nose of one of them is very neatly and
dexterously arranged: the snow storm rises: the winds howl
awfully along the battlements: the waves come curling, leaping,
foaming to shore.&nbsp; Hamlet&rsquo;s umbrella is whirled away
in the storm.&nbsp; He and his two friends stamp on each
other&rsquo;s toes to keep them warm.&nbsp; The storm-spirits
rise in the air, and are whirled howling round the palace and the
rocks.&nbsp; My eyes! what tiles and chimney-pots fly hurtling
through the air!&nbsp; As the storm reaches its height (here the
wind instruments come in with prodigious effect, and I compliment
Mr Brumby and the violoncellos)&mdash;as the snow storm rises
(queek, queek, queek, go the fiddles, and then thrumpty thrump
comes a pizzicato movement in Bob Major, which sends a shiver
into your very boot-soles), the thunder-clouds deepen (bong,
bong, bong, from the violoncellos).&nbsp; The forked lightning
quivers through the clouds in a zig-zag scream of
violins&mdash;and look, look, look! as the frothing, roaring
waves come rushing up the battlements, and over the reeling
parapet, each hissing wave becomes a ghost, sends the
gun-carriages rolling over the platform, and plunges into the
water again.</p>
<p>Hamlet&rsquo;s mother comes on to the battlements to look for
her son.&nbsp; The storm whips her umbrella out of her hands, and
she retires screaming in pattens.</p>
<p>The cabs on the stand in the great market-place at Elsinore
are seen to drive off, and several people are drowned.&nbsp; The
gas-lamps along the street are wrenched from their foundations,
and shoot through the troubled air.&nbsp; Whist, rush, hish! how
the rain roars and pours!&nbsp; The darkness becomes awful,
always deepened by the power of the music&mdash;and see&mdash;in
the midst of a rush, and whirl, and scream of spirits of air and
wave&mdash;what is that ghastly figure moving hither?&nbsp; It
becomes bigger, bigger, as it advances down the
platform&mdash;more ghastly, more horrible, enormous!&nbsp; It is
as tall as the whole stage.&nbsp; It seems to be advancing on the
stalls and pit, and the whole house screams with terror, as the
Ghost of <span class="smcap">the Late Hamlet</span> comes in, and
begins to speak.&nbsp; Several people faint, and the
light-fingered gentry pick pockets furiously in the darkness.</p>
<p>In the pitchy darkness, this awful figure throwing his eyes
about, the gas in the boxes shuddering out of sight, and the
wind-instruments bugling the most horrible wails, the boldest
spectator must have felt frightened.&nbsp; But hark! what is that
silver shimmer of the fiddles?&nbsp; Is it&mdash;can it
be&mdash;the grey dawn peeping in the stormy east?&nbsp; The
ghost&rsquo;s eyes look blankly towards it, and roll a ghastly
agony.&nbsp; Quicker, quicker ply the violins of Phoebus
Apollo.&nbsp; Redder, redder grow the orient clouds.&nbsp;
Cockadoodledoo! crows that great cock which has just come out on
the roof of the palace.&nbsp; And now the round sun himself pops
up from behind the waves of night.&nbsp; Where is the
ghost?&nbsp; He is gone!&nbsp; Purple shadows of morn
&ldquo;slant o&rsquo;er the snowy sward,&rdquo; the city wakes up
in life and sunshine, and we confess we are very much relieved at
the disappearance of the ghost.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t like those
dark scenes in pantomimes.</p>
<p>After the usual business, that Ophelia should be turned into
Columbine was to be expected; but I confess I was a little
shocked when Hamlet&rsquo;s mother became Pantaloon, and was
instantly knocked down by Clown Claudius.&nbsp; Grimaldi is
getting a little old now, but for real humour there are few
clowns like him.&nbsp; Mr Shuter, as the gravedigger, was chaste
and comic, as he always is, and the scene-painters surpassed
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harlequin Conqueror and the Field of Hastings,&rdquo;
at the other house, is very pleasant too.&nbsp; The irascible
William is acted with great vigour by Snoxall, and the battle of
Hastings is a good piece of burlesque.&nbsp; Some trifling
liberties are taken with history, but what liberties will not the
merry genius of pantomime permit himself?&nbsp; At the battle of
Hastings, William is on the point of being defeated by the Sussex
volunteers, very elegantly led by the always pretty Miss Waddy
(as Haco Sharpshooter), when a shot from the Normans kills
Harold.&nbsp; The Fairy Edith hereupon comes forward, and finds
his body, which straightway leaps up a live harlequin, whilst the
Conqueror makes an excellent clown, and the Archbishop of Bayeux
a diverting pantaloon, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>Perhaps these are not the pantomimes we really saw; but one
description will do as well as another.&nbsp; The plots, you see,
are a little intricate and difficult to understand in pantomimes;
and I may have mixed up one with another.&nbsp; That I was at the
theatre on Boxing-night is certain&mdash;but the pit was so full
that I could only see fairy legs glittering in the distance, as I
stood at the door.&nbsp; And if I was badly off, I think there
was a young gentleman behind me worse off still.&nbsp; I own that
he has good reason (though others have not) to speak ill of me
behind my back, and hereby beg his pardon.</p>
<p>Likewise to the gentleman who picked up a party in Piccadilly,
who had slipped and fallen in the snow, and was there on his
back, uttering energetic expressions: that party begs to offer
thanks, and compliments of the season.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s behaviour on New Year&rsquo;s day, I can assure Dr
Holyshade, was highly creditable to the boy.&nbsp; He had
expressed a determination to partake of every dish which was put
on the table; but after soup, fish, roast-beef, and roast-goose,
he retired from active business until the pudding and mince-pies
made their appearance, of which he partook liberally, but not too
freely.&nbsp; And he greatly advanced in my good opinion by
praising the punch, which was of my own manufacture, and which
some gentlemen present (Mr O&rsquo;M&mdash;g&mdash;n, amongst
others) pronounced to be too weak.&nbsp; Too weak! A bottle of
rum, a bottle of Madeira, half a bottle of brandy, and two
bottles and a half of water&mdash;<i>can</i> this mixture be said
to be too weak for any mortal?&nbsp; Our young friend amused the
company during the evening, by exhibiting a two-shilling
magic-lantern, which he had purchased, and likewise by singing
&ldquo;Sally, come up!&rdquo; a quaint, but rather monotonous
melody, which I am told is sung by the poor negro on the banks of
the broad Mississippi.</p>
<p>What other enjoyments did we proffer for the child&rsquo;s
amusement during the Christmas week?&nbsp; A great philosopher
was giving a lecture to young folks at the British
Institution.&nbsp; But when this diversion was proposed to our
young friend Bob, he said, &ldquo;Lecture?&nbsp; No, thank
you.&nbsp; Not as I knows on,&rdquo; and made sarcastic signals
on his nose.&nbsp; Perhaps he is of Dr Johnson&rsquo;s opinion
about lectures: &ldquo;Lectures, sir! what man would go to hear
that imperfectly at a lecture, which he can read at leisure in a
book?&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>I</i> never went, of my own choice, to a
lecture; that I can vow.&nbsp; As for sermons, they are
different; I delight in them, and they cannot, of course, be too
long.</p>
<p>Well, we partook of yet other Christmas delights besides
pantomime, pudding, and pie.&nbsp; One glorious, one delightful,
one most unlucky and pleasant day, we drove in a brougham, with a
famous horse, which carried us more quickly and briskly than any
of your vulgar railways, over Battersea Bridge, on which the
horse&rsquo;s hoofs rung as if it had been iron; through suburban
villages, plum-caked with snow; under a leaden sky, in which the
sun hung like a red-hot warming-pan; by pond after pond, where
not only men and boys, but scores after scores of women and
girls, were sliding, and roaring, and clapping their lean old
sides with laughter, as they tumbled down, and their hobnailed
shoes flew up in the air; the air frosty with a lilac haze,
through which villas, and commons, and churches, and plantations
glimmered.&nbsp; We drive up the hill, Bob and I; we make the
last two miles in eleven minutes; we pass that poor, armless man
who sits there in the cold, following you with his eyes.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t give anything, and Bob looks disappointed.&nbsp; We
are set down neatly at the gate, and a horse-holder opens the
brougham door.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t give anything; again
disappointment on Bob&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; I pay a shilling
apiece, and we enter into the glorious building, which is
decorated for Christmas, and straightway forgetfulness on
Bob&rsquo;s part of everything but that magnificent scene.&nbsp;
The enormous edifice is all decorated for Bob and
Christmas.&nbsp; The stalls, the columns, the fountains, courts,
statues, splendours, are all crowned for Christmas.&nbsp; The
delicious negro is singing his Alabama choruses for Christmas and
Bob.&nbsp; He has scarcely done, when, Tootarootatoo!&nbsp; Mr
Punch is performing his surprising actions, and hanging the
beadle.&nbsp; The stalls are decorated.&nbsp; The
refreshment-tables are piled with good things; at many fountains
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mulled Claret</span>&rdquo; is written
up in appetizing capitals.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mulled Claret&mdash;oh,
jolly!&nbsp; How cold it is!&rdquo; says Bob; I pass on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; says
Bob.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, only three,&rdquo; I say meekly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We dine at seven,&rdquo; sighs Bob, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s
so-o-o coo-old.&rdquo;&nbsp; I still would take no hints.&nbsp;
No claret, no refreshment, no sandwiches, no sausage-rolls for
Bob.&nbsp; At last I am obliged to tell him all.&nbsp; Just
before we left home, a little Christmas bill popped in at the
door and emptied my purse at the threshold.&nbsp; I forgot all
about the transaction, and had to borrow half-a-crown from John
Coachman to pay for our entrance into the palace of
delight.&nbsp; <i>Now</i> you see, Bob, why I could not treat you
on that second of January when we drove to the palace together;
when the girls and boys were sliding on the ponds at Dulwich;
when the darkling river was full of floating ice, and the sun was
like a warming-pan in the leaden sky.</p>
<p>One more Christmas sight we had, of course; and that sight I
think I like as well as Bob himself at Christmas, and at all
seasons.&nbsp; We went to a certain garden of delight, where,
whatever your cares are, I think you can manage to forget some of
them, and muse, and be not unhappy; to a garden beginning with a
Z, which is as lively as Noah&rsquo;s ark; where the fox has
brought his brush, and the cock has brought his comb, and the
elephant has brought his trunk, and the kangaroo has brought his
bag, and the condor his old white wig and black satin hood.&nbsp;
On this day it was so cold that the white bears winked their pink
eyes, as they plapped up and down by their pool, and seemed to
say, &ldquo;Aha, this weather reminds us of dear
home!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cold! bah!&nbsp; I have got such a warm
coat,&rdquo; says brother Bruin, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
mind&rdquo;; and he laughs on his pole, and clucks down a
bun.&nbsp; The squealing hy&aelig;nas gnashed their teeth and
laughed at us quite refreshingly at their window; and, cold as it
was, Tiger, Tiger, burning bright, glared at us red-hot through
his bars, and snorted blasts of hell.&nbsp; The woolly camel
leered at us quite kindly as he paced round his ring on his
silent pads.&nbsp; We went to our favourite places.&nbsp; Our
dear wambat came up, and had himself scratched very
affably.&nbsp; Our fellow-creatures in the monkey room held out
their little black hands, and piteously asked us for Christmas
alms.&nbsp; Those darling alligators on their rock winked at us
in the most friendly way.&nbsp; The solemn eagles sat alone, and
scowled at us from their peaks; whilst little Tom Ratel tumbled
over head and heels for us in his usual diverting manner.&nbsp;
If I have cares in my mind, I come to the Zoo, and fancy they
don&rsquo;t pass the gate.&nbsp; I recognise my friends, my
enemies, in countless cages.&nbsp; I entertained the eagle, the
vulture, the old billy-goat, and the black-pated, crimson-necked,
blear-eyed, baggy, hook-beaked old marabou stork yesterday at
dinner; and when Bob&rsquo;s aunt came to tea in the evening, and
asked him what he had seen, he stepped up to her gravely, and
said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First I saw the white bear, then I saw the
black,<br />
Then I saw the camel with a hump upon his back.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Chorus of Children</i>.</p>
<p>Then I saw the camel with a <span class="GutSmall">HUMP</span>
upon his back!</p>
<p>Then I saw the grey wolf, with mutton in his maw;<br />
Then I saw the wambat waddle in the straw;<br />
Then I saw the elephant with his waving trunk,<br />
Then I saw the monkeys&mdash;mercy, how unpleasantly
they&mdash;smelt!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There.&nbsp; No one can beat that piece of wit, can he
Bob?&nbsp; And so it is over; but we had a jolly time, whilst you
were with us, hadn&rsquo;t we?&nbsp; Present my respects to the
doctor; and I hope, my boy, we may spend another merry Christmas
next year.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
